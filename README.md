# Infinito

**Infinito began in August of 2019 as an infintely-generating platformer written with a JavaScript engine.**

Five years later we set our sights on re-implementing the game in a Rust framework by reusing and expanding upon our original ideas and assets; with the goal of creating a finished product this time around.

Created using the [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra) framework. Credits to 17cupsofcoffee.

**Run the game from the directory with the `cargo run` command.**

Must install the following dependcies beforehand: 
- Rust
- SDL 2.0 development libraries
- ALSA development libraries (non-Linux users can ignore this one)
